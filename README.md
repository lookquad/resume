# Résumé

This repository hosts the source code of my résumé site. It's created to explore things on the Web like some new HTML elements, CSS and JavaScripts tricks, and the use of frameworks. For example, the site was [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and [Underscores.js](https://underscorejs.org/). As of 2018, the site is now rebuilt using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).
